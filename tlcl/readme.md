## Info
The `src/case4-2` script showcases bash's `case` and `read`.

Run `src/posit-params` to see the `$*`, `"$*"`, `$@`, and `"$@"` differences.

The `src/sys_info_page` script is an argparse example.

The `show_user_info` script plays with `read` and `IFS`.

The `src/trap_demo` script shows how to catch signals with `trap`.
